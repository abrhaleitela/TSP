Travel Salesmen Problem recalculation
This project tries to solve the most complex and NP-hard problem in computer science, Travel Salesmen Problem, (TSP) recalculation javascript app. 
TSP is defined to be as follows; from a given set of locations find a path starting from one location that visits all the locations one and only once.

I have used some google maps API's and and O-Mopsi server API's to build the app.
It is fully location based app that asks a user to enter his/her target locations and the app will automatically find the best route in real map.
And the app is voice interactive where a user can conveniently talk to his/her app, so that real actions can happen.
This reduces so many accident that accurs when a user drives a car while using his/her phone. 

The functionalities of the project are listed in the features.pdf file.
